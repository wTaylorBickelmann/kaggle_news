    Headline: “Squaring Up Calories: How BMI, Cross-Terms and a Trio of Boosters Boosted Calorie-Burn Predictions”<br><br>In a recent Kaggle notebook tackling calorie-expenditure forecasting, an uncommonly aggressive feature-engineering pipeline—combined with a three-model gradient-boosting ensemble—delivers state-of-the-art results. The author begins by carefully encoding “Sex” as a true categorical type (instead of dummy drops) to exploit CatBoost’s and LightGBM’s native handling of categories.  <br><br>Next comes the fireworks in feature engineering. Beyond simply calculating Body-Mass-Index (BMI), the script:  <br>• Squares and takes the square root of every key numeric variable (Age, Height, Weight, Duration, Heart_Rate, Body_Temp, BMI) to expose non-linear signals.  <br>• Generates exhaustive pairwise interaction terms by multiplying each numeric feature with every other (including BMI), capturing subtle, higher-order relationships—think “Age × Heart_Rate” or “√Weight × Duration².”  <br><br>On the modeling front, the notebook fits three heavy hitters—CatBoostRegressor, XGBRegressor, and LGBMRegressor—each tuned for low learning rates, modest tree depth, and early stopping on a 5-fold cross-validated log-scale RMSE. The target Calories are log1p-transformed to stabilize variance and directly optimize RMSLE, then inverse-transformed before final submission.  <br><br>The real novelty lies in the weighted blending: test-set predictions are averaged across folds for each model, then combined in a 40% XGBoost / 30% CatBoost / 30% LightGBM mix. This carefully calibrated cocktail reduces variance, leverages each booster’s idiosyncratic strengths, and delivers one of the top leaderboard scores.  <br><br>Key takeaway: meticulous, domain-inspired feature engineering—especially squared, root, and cross-term expansions—paired with a balanced booster ensemble can dramatically sharpen regression accuracy, even on a seemingly simple problem like estimating calories burned.
