    How much does a teen’s nightly shut-eye or afternoon scroll time really matter for grades? A recent Kaggle notebook tackles exactly that question with surprisingly straightforward—but instructive—feature engineering and modeling.<br><br>After loading a 1,000-row dataset of high-schoolers, the author zeroes in on four predictors: daily study hours, sleep hours, social-media hours, and exercise frequency. Rather than roll out dozens of engineered variables or high-flying ensembles, the notebook relies on classic exploratory data analysis—histograms, pairplots and a full correlation heatmap—to vet which behaviors align most with exam scores.<br><br>Surprisingly, study time and sleep show the strongest positive correlations (around 0.45 and 0.30), while social-media use drags modestly negative. Exercise frequency barely budges the needle. Armed with those insights, the author fits a plain-vanilla linear regression, splitting 80/20 into train and test sets with a fixed random state for reproducibility.<br><br>No polynomial features, no log transforms and no cross-validated grid search—just raw predictors. Yet the model still achieves an R² in the 0.40–0.50 range and an RMSE near 8 points on a 100-point scale. In practical terms, adding an extra hour of study or sleep per day predicts a 2–3 point exam bump.<br><br>What’s most interesting isn’t a breakthrough algorithm but the disciplined “less is more” approach: use basic visualization to spotlight the truly informative habits, then stick to a transparent linear model. It’s a masterclass in keeping feature engineering lean while delivering actionable, interpretable results.
