    Data scientists on a recent Kaggle competition have leaned hard on an unlikely hero: meticulous hand-tuned weight–space enumeration. Rather than training a single monolithic model or relying exclusively on off-the-shelf AutoML, the team assembled seven distinct “solutions” (including an AutoGluon baseline and several bespoke neural architectures) into a weighted ensemble—and then set about fine-tuning those weights by small, systematic perturbations.<br><br>At the heart of their approach is what they call a “curved line W”: a one-dimensional slice through the ensemble’s seven-dimensional weight space. Starting from a logical prior (sub-weights of roughly –0.15, –0.05, +0.10, +0.20, +0.10, –0.05, –0.15), they adjust the central model’s contribution by only a few thousandths—0.002 here, 0.005 there—and mirror those changes symmetrically across the outer models. After each tweak, they submit to Kaggle for a quick leaderboard score, then decide to “lock in” or backtrack. In parallel, they experiment with “asc/desc” sorting of predictions, blending ascending-order and descending-order runs with a 55/45 split.<br><br>This old-school coordinate search—three days of incremental tweaks—yielded measurable gains, driving their public LB down from 0.05703 to 0.05670. What’s unusual isn’t the lack of deep feature engineering (none was explicitly shown) but the nearly artisanal weight-tuning dance: part local enumeration, part “friendly intersections” of models, part gut feel. It’s a reminder that, even in 2025, ­careful human-driven ensemble craft can still outhustle brute-force AutoML.
