    Headline: “From BMI to Boosters: How a Kaggle Grandmaster Stacks Features—and Models—to Predict Calorie Burn”<br><br>In a recent Kaggle Playground competition, an enterprising data scientist unveiled a machine-learning pipeline that marries aggressive feature engineering with a three-model gradient-boosting ensemble, capped by a simple Ridge stacker. The result? A record-setting RMSLE of 0.05941 in predicting calorie expenditure.<br><br>What Makes This Notebook Stand Out<br>• Polymath-style features: Beyond the obvious (Height, Weight, Age, Duration, HeartRate, Temperature), the author computes BMI, log-transformed duration, heart rate × duration, temperature per minute and weight ÷ age.  <br>• Pairwise blitz: Every numeric feature is squared, square-rooted and then cross-multiplied with every other numeric column—supercharging the dataset with higher-order interactions.  <br>• Log-1p magic: A log transform on both the Duration input and the Calories target stabilizes variance and tames outliers, a classic trick applied here at scale.  <br><br>The Modeling Playbook<br>1. Three diverse boosters—CatBoost, XGBoost and LightGBM—are each tuned with robust hyperparameters, early stopping and (for CatBoost) native categorical handling of the binary Sex variable.  <br>2. A five-fold cross-validation loop yields out-of-fold predictions for each base learner, ensuring every training sample contributes a fair estimate.  <br>3. A lightweight Ridge regression then ingests these “second-level” features—basically the three OOF prediction columns—and learns to blend them into a final score.  <br><br>Why It’s Interesting<br>• Hybrid simplicity: Instead of a deep neural network or a labyrinth of stacks, the notebook opts for a three-model “committee” plus a linear meta-model, demonstrating that well-tuned boosters can still reign supreme.  <br>• Feature deluge controlled: Generating hundreds of new columns can easily overfit, yet the combination of log transforms, careful clipping of final predictions (to a realistic 1–314 calorie range) and a convex Ridge penalization tames complexity.  <br>• Reproducible rigor: With open-source libraries and a step-by-step code path—from imports to final CSV output—the notebook reads like a recipe for success.  <br><br>Bottom Line<br>In this Kaggle Playground Series entry, no single magic algorithm appears. Instead, it’s the meticulous layering of feature transformations and the judicious ensemble of three gradient-boosters with a linear combiner that pushes performance over the edge. The approach may not rewrite the rules of machine learning, but it offers a master class in execution: build more, blend wisely, and always keep your predictions in check.
