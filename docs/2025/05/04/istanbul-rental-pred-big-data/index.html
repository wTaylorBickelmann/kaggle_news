    Headline: “Spark’s Istanbul Rental Model Turns Its Own Answer Into a Feature—And Scores Nearly Perfectly”<br><br>In a recent Kaggle exploration of Istanbul apartment rentals, an unconventional—but highly effective—feature-engineering gambit steals the show. The analyst loads raw listing data into a local PySpark session, explores correlations with Seaborn, and then embarks on a flurry of calculated columns that boost a straightforward linear regression to surprisingly lofty R² scores.<br><br>Key Modeling Steps<br>• Data ingestion and cleanup. After reading 65,000+ records into Spark DataFrames, the notebook drops nulls and engineers a “total_rooms” field by summing bedrooms and living rooms.  <br>• Floor flags. Using Spark’s built-in aggregation, the script identifies the building’s maximum floor dynamically and tags each listing as ground floor, top floor, or even subterranean. A bespoke “risky_floor” flag further marks properties over five stories in structures older than 20 years.  <br>• Ratio features (and a sneaky leak). The model introduces m2_per_room and—crucially—price_per_m2, computed by dividing the target (price) by area. When paired with “area,” this engineered ratio practically hands the regression its answer.  <br>• VectorAssembler & Spark ML. Twelve numeric fields (including the price-per-square-meter leak) feed directly into a Spark ML Pipeline. No categorical encoding beyond booleans is applied—age categories are created but omitted from modeling.  <br>• Validation. An 80/20 train-test split and Spark’s LinearRegression routine yield near-perfect R², a tell-tale sign that the model is learning the target by heart rather than generalizing.<br><br>What’s Unusual—and Why It Matters<br>Analysts rarely grant models access to any transformation of the very metric they’re trying to predict. By constructing price_per_m2, the notebook effectively encodes price into a feature, then reassembles it via area to retrieve the original. While this “data leakage” supercharges performance metrics, it undermines real-world utility: a model should anticipate rental price from independent attributes like location, age, or layout—not its own future output.<br><br>Takeaways and Results<br>• Clever Spark use: Leveraging PySpark DataFrames, caching, dynamic max-floor calculations, and VectorAssembler demonstrates how big-data tools can streamline feature pipelines—even on moderate datasets.  <br>• Feature engineering wins—and warns: While floor flags and per-room ratios capture genuine apartment dynamics, any feature derived directly from the label should ring alarm bells.  <br>• Benchmark caution: A sky-high R² (often north of 0.95) is exciting—but may signal target leakage rather than predictive insight.<br><br>In sum, the Istanbul Rental Predict notebook is a case study in both the power and pitfalls of aggressive feature engineering. Its standout lesson for data professionals: engineer with intention—and never feed your model the answer key.
