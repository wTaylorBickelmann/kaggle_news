    Headline: “Renting Istanbul, One Spark at a Time: How a Simple Linear Model Got a Boost from a Price-Per-Meter Trick”<br><br>In a recent Kaggle notebook tackling Istanbul’s apartment-for-rent market, the author leans on PySpark’s ML pipeline and some crafty feature engineering to power a straightforward linear regression. Although nothing in the code screams “deep learning,” the notebook’s blend of Spark on Kaggle plus a handful of synthetic predictors yields surprisingly strong R² scores—at least on paper.<br><br>Feature Engineering Highlights<br>- Ratio features: The author computes m²_per_room (area divided by total rooms) and, more controversially, price_per_m2 (price ÷ area). The latter is essentially a piece of the target folded back into the inputs—a textbook case of “data leakage” that can artificially inflate performance.  <br>- Floor indicators: Beyond raw floor number, binary flags identify ground floor (floor = 0), top floor (compared to the global maximum floor in the dataset), underground (floor < 0) and a bespoke “risky_floor” flag (old units above the fifth floor).  <br>- Room aggregation: The script sums “room” plus “living room” into total_rooms, then bins “age” into categories (0–5, 6–15, 16–30, 30+)—though oddly, the age category is created and never one-hot encoded into the final feature set.<br><br>Pipeline & Modeling<br>By dropping nulls, assembling a 12-column feature vector and training Spark ML’s LinearRegression, the notebook delivers an R² score with near-immediate speed on a local SparkSession. No regularization, no ensemble or hyperparameter tuning—just default linear regressor settings and an 80/20 train-test split.<br><br>What’s Unusual?<br>1. PySpark on Kaggle: It’s rare to see a full SparkSession spun up in a notebook environment designed for Pandas.  <br>2. Price-per-m2 leak: Injecting a feature derived directly from the target creates almost a “cheat code,” boosting the score but undermining real-world validity.  <br>3. Global max floor as a benchmark for “top floor”: Without building-level grouping, the “top floor” flag treats every high-rise the same, ignoring neighborhood or block-by-block context.<br><br>Bottom Line<br>The notebook is a neat illustration of rapid prototyping with Spark ML—even if some shortcuts (price_leak, unused age bins) limit its production-readiness. It’s a reminder that in data science, the cleverest tricks sometimes come with asterisks.
