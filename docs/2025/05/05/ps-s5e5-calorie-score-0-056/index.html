    Headline: “Brute-Force Feature Crosses and a Three-Way Boosting Powerhouse Supercharge Kaggle’s Calorie Prediction”<br><br>In a recent Kaggle Playground challenge, a contributor took a refreshingly no-holds-barred approach to predict exercise calories burned. Rather than obsessing over exotic deep nets or painstaking manual feature crafting, the notebook’s author leaned into brute-force feature generation and a robust ensemble of today’s top tree-based learners. The result: surprisingly accurate calorie estimates—and a template for rapid, high-impact modelling.  <br><br>Exploratory Diagnostics and Log-Transforms  <br>The analysis begins classically, with histograms, boxplots and a log(1 + Calories) transform to tame skew and stabilize variance. Six core predictors—Age, Height, Weight, Duration, Heart_Rate and Body_Temp—are profiled individually and against the target. A quick Sex vs. Calories boxplot hints at gender differences, and a heatmap confirms only moderate raw correlations, signaling room for feature expansion.  <br><br>Brute-Force Pairwise Cross Terms  <br>Here’s the notebook’s boldest move: it generates every possible pairwise product among the six numeric features—15 new “cross term” dimensions in all. A waterfall of interactions like Age × Heart_Rate or Duration × Body_Temp floods the dataset. Such brute-force engineering may seem crude—yet tree-based methods excel at picking out the few signal-heavy splits amid the noise.  <br><br>Categorical Sex Encoding  <br>Sex is label-encoded into a categorical type and directly fed into CatBoost (which natively handles cats) and even toggled on for XGBoost. This lets each model automatically learn gender-specific effects without manual one-hot bloat.  <br><br>A Trio of Gradient Boosters  <br>For predictions, the author stitches together three workhorse regressors:  <br> • CatBoostRegressor (with early stopping after 100 rounds)  <br> • XGBRegressor (depth=10, η=0.02, subsample=0.9, colsample=0.7, γ=0.01)  <br> • LGBMRegressor (matching depth and sampling)  <br><br>Each undergoes 5-fold cross-validation on log-transformed targets. Out-of-fold RMSLE scores hover in the low-single-digit range (Kagglers report ~0.025), and test-set predictions are averaged across folds and models.  <br><br>Why It’s Unusual—and Effective  <br>Few notebooks so gleefully embrace feature explosion—yet by pairing it with powerful boosting engines and a simple log transform, the strategy punches well above its weight. Rather than hours of manual domain-specific crafting, one line of code spawns dozens of candidate predictors, while the ensemble irons out overfitting.  <br><br>This “brute-force meets best-in-class boosters” playbook offers a rapid, high-ROI path for structured-data problems: generate broad interactions, normalize the target, and let CatBoost, XGBoost and LightGBM battle it out in a friendly 5-fold bracket. The pay-off in accuracy makes it a compelling template for data scientists racing against the clock.
