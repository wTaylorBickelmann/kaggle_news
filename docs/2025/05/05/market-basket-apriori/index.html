    Headline: “Decoding Your Grocery Cart: How an Unsupervised ‘Apriori’ Model Turns Shoppers into Data Scientists”<br><br>In a recent Kaggle notebook, a simple market‐basket dataset morphs into a rich web of shopping insights—all without a single labeled outcome. The core modelling strategy is classical association rule mining: the Apriori algorithm sifts through 20,000 café‐style transactions to identify itemsets appearing together at least 2% of the time (min_support=0.02), then derives “if‐then” rules whose confidence exceeds 30%.  <br><br>What stands out is the feature‐engineering pipeline. Each basket—originally just a list of up to 20 product names—is one‐hot encoded via mlxtend’s TransactionEncoder into a binary matrix of items-as-features. This unsupervised transform effectively creates hundreds of new Boolean “features” (OliveOil? TRUE/FALSE, MineralWater? TRUE/FALSE) so that Apriori can rapidly count co-occurrences.  <br><br>But the notebook doesn’t stop at tables of support, confidence and lift. It layers on three visualizations that bring these abstract measures to life:  <br>• A bubble chart plotting each rule’s antecedents vs. consequents, with bubble size proportional to lift and color intensity keyed to confidence. Outliers immediately jump out—like edges showing that “shrimp ➔ eggs” may defy supermarket intuition.  <br>• A network graph built with NetworkX, in which items are nodes and directed edges carry live confidence scores and lift‐weighted thickness—turning your shopping list into a mini social network.  <br>• A ranked bar chart of the top 10 rules by lift, spotlighting the strongest non-obvious affinities (for example, “sparkling water ➔ pastry” might surface as a high-lift surprise).  <br><br>This blend of straightforward feature engineering and classic apriori modelling, spiced up with richly annotated visuals, makes an old algorithm feel new. It’s a reminder that in the unsupervised world, clever encoding and insightful plotting can reveal patterns even in the most everyday data—like the contents of your grocery basket.
